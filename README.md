# odin-rock-paper-scissors
Rock, paper, scissors Javascript project from The Odin Project

This project is aimed at helping develop basic Javascript skills, primarily focused on functions and function returns. The purpose of this project is to create a playable version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, in which a human player plays against the computer. The game keeps track of who wins each round, and after 5 rounds, declares a winner.
